JavaScript Development Homework Repository
==========================================

> Office hours with Sasha (`@sasha` on Slack):<br>
Mondays & Wednesdays from 5:00-6:00, located at the common table to the left of the front desk.

How To Use This Repo
--------------------

This is the repository where you'll submit your homework.    
To set up this repository:

1. Fork this repository (in your browser).
2. Follow the instructions in your browser to clone your fork to your `~/JSD` folder.
3. Create a directory in the `JS-SF-10-homework` folder using your first name, a dash, and your github account name (for instance, `Sasha-svodnik`). That will make it easier for me to remember everyone's github name. :)
4. For each homework assignment, make sure to copy over the `Homework-#` directory from your start files to your named homework directory.

Example of how your local homework directory should be structured:


    |-- JSD/
        |-- JS-SF-10-homework/ (cloned from Github)
            |-- firstName-githubUsername/
                |-- Homework-1/
                    |- 99-bottles-of-beer
                    |- fizzbuzz
                |-- Homework-2/
                    |- temp-converter
                |-- Homework-3/
                    |- json-homework
                    |- object-homework
                |-- Homework-4/
                |-- Homework-5/
                    ...



Weekly Homework
---------------
Homework will be [assigned on Wednesdays](https://svodnik.github.io/jsd10/pages/homework.html), due the following Monday.     
If any files are in the pull request outside of your personal folder, I will send it back to you to fix!

**Submit homework by pushing to your fork of the JS-SF-10-homework repo, then submit a pull request**
